# Analyzing Behavior Patterns During Exam Periods Through Instagram Usage Data
In this project, I aim to explore the impact of exam periods on my personal behavior focusing on how my Instagram usage patterns change. By using the data available on Instagram and analyzing it, this study will offer insights into how external events like exams influence daily habits. 
## Main Question to be Examined:
- Is there a significant change in number of interactions like comments, likes, poll answers, etc. when it is an exam period?
## Method:
- I will organise the raw data using Python and extact the necesearry statistics and visualizations using relevant libraries. Sepearting the data as exam and non-exam periods, I will be able to make comparisions.
## Dataset:
- I will use the dataset which Instagram provides. It will be useful since it contains all kind of information like the ads clicked, videos watched, posts liked, etc. about my usage.
## Expected Results:
- I expect a significant decrease in number of interactions during exam periods since there is limited time to use Instagram.
